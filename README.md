# gd32f4pac
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to GD32F4 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

It is based on a [fork](https://github.com/RationalAsh/gd32-rs) of the [original gd32-rs repo](https://github.com/gd32-rust/gd32-rs) and is being published 
separately. 

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.
